Designed and implemented Memory Module of Operating system 

## Predefined
 - Size of Main Memory
 - Memory Management Technique: Dynamic Partitioning with Best Fit Algorithm
 
 ## Features

 - The memory module is able to allocate/deallocate memory to each process as it arrives
 - The current state of memory is always available and specifies the used and free spaces

## Additional Features
 - Number of input processes in Memory
 - Average/Max/Min size of processes in Memory
